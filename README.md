Credit Risk Analysis Report

The purpose of this analysis is to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk by using various techniques and a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.


 Confusion matrix summary

**Accuracy**: The overall accuracy is 99%, indicating that 99% of the predictions are correct.
**Precision**: 85% of the predicted positive cases are actually true positive cases.

**Recall**: it's 0.91, indicating that 91% of the actual positive cases are correctly predicted.
**F1-score**: it's 0.88, very close to 1, which tells this model does a good job at predicting the creditworthiness of borrowers.



Justification for recommending the model: Given the high accuracy, reasonable precision, and strong recall, the model for credit risk assessment proves efficient to be used at the company.
